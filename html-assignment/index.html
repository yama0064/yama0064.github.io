    <h1>Itsuki Yamagishi</h1>
    <h2>Opening Message</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Itsuki from Japan. I am taking the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program. I had been going to an English school in Toronto from April to July this year, so this is my 2<sup>nd</sup> time coming to Canada. Since I have to study not only about design but also English, I am very struggling with this school life. <br>Please feel free to talk to me anytime! It would help me improve my English skills.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I like playing some <em>sports</em> (soccer, ping-pong, badminton, etc...). I also like playing <em>video games</em> (RPG, action, fighting, etc...). My favorite game is "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate". I would like to start going to the training gym on campus after getting used to school life. I have a <em>dog</em> at home who turns 15 this October, so I miss her a lot. I am looking for English movies and TV shows to watch in my leisure time, so please tell me your favorite ones!<blockquote>I never lose. I either win or learn. - <cite>Nelson Mandela</cite></blockquote>
